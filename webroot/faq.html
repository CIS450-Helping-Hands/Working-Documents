      <h3>What is Home Health Care?</h3>
      <div>
       <p>
        Professional home health care services includes a broad range of care and
        support services for those who are recovering from a hospital stay, who are
        disabled, chronically- or terminally-ill, and need assistance with the
        essential activities of daily living.
       </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Who needs Home Health Care?</h3>
      <div>
       <ul>
        <li>Older individuals who have health problems, but who want to maintain
            their independence in their homes with the support of a professional
            caregiver.</li>
        <li>Patients of all ages who return home after surgery, and need care,
            supervision or assistance.</li>
        <li>Mothers and newborns, home from the hospital after 24 or 48 hours who
            are in need of further education, support and clinical assessment
            skills of a trained nurse.</li>
        <li>Young adults, recovering from accidents or injuries, who can manage on
            their own - if they know an experienced healthcare worker, will be
            there when needed.</li>
        <li>Intellectually disabled adults who need support to remain in the
            mainstream of their community.</li>
        <li>Adults who want their parents to have quality care at home.</li>
        <li>And millions of individuals with chronic diseases and disabilities,
            like Alzheimer's, heart failure, kidney disease, or diabetes, who need
            careful monitoring but do not want or need to enter a nursing home or
            skilled care facility.</li>
       </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>What can I expect from the first visit?</h3>
      <div>
       <p>
        On the first visit, a nurse will conduct an initial assessment.  At Helping
        Hands Home Services, this thorough interview and evaluation is part of our
        coordinated approach to managing your overall health status. Our evaluation
        focuses on educating you in self-care management.  Our team approach
        facilitates an easier transition for you from a hospital or nursing
        facility to your home, and actively engages you and your caregivers in your
        health care.
       </p>
      </div>
      <h3>How often will my home health care visits be?</h3>
      <div>
       <p>
        The frequency of home health care visits and the services provided are
        based on your needs and agreed upon in your personal care plan.
       </p>
      </div>
      <h3>My doctor is ordering home health care for me; can I request Helping
          Hands Home Services by name?</h3>
      <div>
       <p>
        Absolutely! We would be honored to care for you or your loved one. Federal
        law gives patients the freedom to choose their health care provider.
       </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Who pays for home health care services?</h3>
      <div>
       <p>
        Every case is different.  Many families bear the expense of privately
        paying for the care of loved ones. Often families overlook the home care
        service in their private insurance.  Check with your carrier to see if the
        service is covered. Also, if you meet certain eligibility requirements,
        Medicaid and Long-term Insurance may pay for your covered home health care
        for as long as you are eligible.
       </p>
      </div>
      <h3>I have Medicaid already, how do I know if I qualify for home care
          services?</h3>
      <div>
       <p>
        Contact your local Social Service Department, speak with your assigned
        caseworker to determine your eligibility for long term care service.
       </p>
      </div>
      <h3>What’s the difference between home care and private care?</h3>
      <div>
       <p>
        Home care typically involves health-related services that are delivered to
        you in your home and are ordered by your physician to help your recovery.
        Private care is a type of home care. If you need home care that extends
        beyond services covered by insurance, our Private Care services provide
        day-to-day support to help you continue to live safely and independently in
        your home.
       </p>
      </div>
      <h3>How do I know if the person coming into my home is trustworthy?</h3>
      <div>
       <p>
        At Helping Hands Home Services, you can be sure that every member that
        comes into your home is highly trained, trustworthy and professional. Every
        member of your team offers a level of skill that comes with experience and
        compassion that comes with true caring.
       </p>
      </div>
      <h3>What is the difference between agencies that independently contract their
          caregivers or agencies that employ their caregivers?</h3>
      <div>
       <p>
        If you hire an independent contractor you are considered the employer and
        hold all liability and responsibility for the employee. The client is
        responsible for payroll taxes, worker's compensation, liability, bonding,
        and instructing the caregiver. The client is vulnerable for tax
        accountability as well as for lawsuits from an independently contracted
        caregiver. If you hire an agency that has employees the agency takes all
        the employer responsibilities.  Reputable agencies will protect themselves,
        their clients, and their caregivers with workers compensation, criminal
        checks, solid reference checks, liability insurance and bonding.
       </p>
      </div>
      <h3>What does it take to get started?</h3>
      <div>
       <p>
        We invite you to call or e-mail. Our agency will return your call at your
        convenience and you may interview us by phone. If you are pleased, you may
        set up a consultation in your home, your loved one’s home, hospital, or our
        office. At that time, our consultant will explain in detail the services we
        have to offer.
